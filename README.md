# TREXIO tutorials

The goal of this repository is to provide material for new users of the TREXIO library in general 
and of the Python API in particular.

To download a local copy of the `.ipynb` files, you can either
[clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
or navigate to any of the documents listed below and download it individually.


## Content

1. [Learn how to write and read data using TREXIO API](notebooks/tutorial_benzene.md): the basics.


### Why Jupyter Notebooks?


 * Jupyter notebooks are a common format for communicating scientific 
   information.
 * Jupyter notebooks can be launched in [Binder](https://www.mybinder.org), so that users can interact
   with tutorials.


### Note

You may notice that the notebooks are stored in markdown format (`.md` files) 
instead of conventional `.ipynb`. 
Conversion between `.ipynb` and `.md` notebook formats is facilitated by the 
[jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package.
